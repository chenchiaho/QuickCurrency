# QuickCurrency
=======================

This App adopted MVVM architecture since it's one of the most modern and popular one, and it comes with various benefits.
The file structure is more clean, you can easily tell which file might belong to which folder,
it separates concerns between layers, 
and since ViewModel is life-cycle aware, it automatically helps you save and retrieve data when turning the phone, which is convenient.

I used Moshi to handle and parse Json file. I chose it over Gson simply because I'm more experienced with it.

Overall, I enjoyed building the app. Thank you so much for reading!
